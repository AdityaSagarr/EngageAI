# ðŸš€ EngageAI: Automating Client Outreach ðŸ¤–

## Overview

EngageAI is an innovative project designed to streamline the client outreach process for job applications using advanced AI technologies. This project harnesses the power of the open-source **Llama 3.1 LLM**, integrated with **ChromaDB**, **LangChain**, and **Streamlit**, to facilitate cold emailing strategies for software service companies targeting potential clients like **Nike** and **JP Morgan**.

## Problem Statement

In a highly competitive landscape, sales teams at software service companies such as **TCS**, **Infosys**, **Accenture**, and **Cognizant** often seek to connect with potential clients by identifying job postings on client portals. For instance, when a client like **Nike** posts a requirement for a software engineer with expertise in **AI/ML**, sales representatives need to craft compelling emails that effectively showcase their capabilities to fulfill those specific needs.

## How It Works

1. **Job Portal Scraping**: The system scrapes job postings to extract relevant skills and descriptions.
2. **LLM-Powered Email Generation**: EngageAI utilizes **Llama 3.1** to analyze job requirements and generate personalized cold emails tailored to the client's needs.
3. **Portfolio Matching**: By integrating with **ChromaDB**, the tool retrieves relevant portfolio links that highlight past projects aligned with the required skills.

## Technical Architecture

- **LangChain**: Used for data extraction from job postings.
- **Llama 3.1/OpenAI LLM**: Generates customized emails based on job descriptions.
- **ChromaDB**: A vector database for storing and retrieving skill-specific portfolios.

- `TEST.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook for testing various functionalities.
- `app.py`: The main application file built with Streamlit.
